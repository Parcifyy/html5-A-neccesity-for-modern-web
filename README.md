### HELLO! :)
Howdy there!, I'm Parcifyy, I'm an aspiring UX Engineer, this is my submission to the [Zuri team](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheZuriTeam), an assignment for the full stack program.....This is like a personal note I decided to add myself entering into the full stack development world as a newbie, and to let myself feel part of a large family on [Github](www.github.com).

> Let's dive right in....

## 1. INTRODUCTION 
This is a repo about the importance of HTML: [check out learning html for beginners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML),the role it has come to have in the website development realm over the years with website examples, over 40 tag explanation used for structuring the web that shows how since the days Tim berners lee invented the [world Wide Web](https://www.ted.com/speakers/tim_berners_lee) how it has curated the structure for the internet we all enjoy today. Feel free to post an [issue](https://github.com/Parcifyy/html5-A-neccesity-for-modern-web/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/Parcifyy/html5-A-neccesity-for-modern-web/pulls) for this [repo](https://github.com/Parcifyy/html5-A-neccesity-for-modern-web)

## 2. BRIEF WALKTHROUGH (BODY)

* HTML was invented by Tim Berners Lee in 1989, not to bore you with much story, it's what is typically used to structure a web page for a website, before which the structure of web pages looked unstructured, unorganized. He basically gave structure to the web, thanks Tim! :)
* HTML is a markup laguage, what this means to you simply put as a beginner is that, we have text and information we have to display in web browsers in form of websites so we need a way to structure that and Tim gladly created a way to do that with the use of what we call [HTML semantics](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) & [Tags](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-tags-complete-reference/)
* Now you probably know that everything in computer science as a whole has rules that must be followed for everything to work out, that itself can be a frustrating endeavor :), that's what gave birth to proper 'HTML semantics' which is typically the proper use of semantic elements and non-semantic elements in the proper manner to help structure the content of a web page so the computer could make best use of our content.
* If I got you lost up till now semantics is all about giving 'meaning' and structure to something. Semantic elements in HTML describes both it's meaning to browser and developer, while a non-semantic elements does not, Let's take a look at a whole lot of both categories and explain them briefly:

  _ ### * Sematic elements: 
         - <DOCTYPE! html> : Not necessarily or technically a tag by itslef it defines to browser that we are dealing with an html5 type document.
         - <html></html> : Root element for our html document.
         - <head></head> : Contains elements that are hidden behind the scenes and perform important functions.
         - <style></style> : It's a style of CSS attribution to elements of our html document that's inline with the html code, doesn't have a seperate file that                             dedicated css file.
         - <title></title> : This is a very important tag that bears the name of the html document, it's displayed in the title bar of the browser.
         - <base/> : This is used to specify the base url for other urls on a particular page, and prefixes every other link on the page 
                     e.g https://github.com/Parcifyy. It's usually in the head tag, no single document can have two base tags.
         - <noscript></noscript> : This tag is used to display the text in browsers that don't support the script tag or browsers where it disabled by the user,
                                   interestingly used in both head and body tags.
         - <scipt></script> : This tag contains scripting statements or points to an external script file.
         - <meta/> : The meta tag provides additional information about an html document, it's very important when building websites to add one as 
                     they are used by search engines, web services, searches e.tc.....it usually in the head tag.
         - <body></body> : This tag is used to enclose all visible aspects of the website on the front end. It's the 3rd in heirachy in an html document after
                           the <DOCTYPE! html> & <html></html> tags respectively.
         - <a></a> : This tag is used to create an hyperlink on the web page, this hyperlink is used to link the web page to other web pages. it has attributes.
         - <acronym></acronym> : The acronym tag is used to define an acronym, it helps to give useful information to the web browser & search engines. It
                                normally has attributes.
         - <address></address> : The address tag is used indicate the contact information of a person or an organization, it could either for example be within 
                                 an article tag or body tag.
         - <area>: It is used to map a portion of an image to make it clickable. It's an empty tag since it doesn't have closing tags. It usually has attributes.
         - <article></article>: This tag is used to represent a specific content within a particlar website, represents a component of a page.
